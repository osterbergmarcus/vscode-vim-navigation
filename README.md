# vscode-vim-navigation

### Simple keybindings for improving side bar/panel/lists navigation
Move around more freely using `ctrl+h/j/k/l` or map your own keys

Features:
- Move around in file explorer and modify files/folders (inspired by NERDtree)
- Navigate find in files search results
- Navigate find results
- Move between workbench views (similar to viewport splitting/moving in vim)
- Navigate problems view list
- Navigate between panel views
- Navigate command palette result list
- Navigate suggestions list

Nice to have features:
- Jump between side bar/panel/workbench

### Use together with [VSCodeVim](https://github.com/VSCodeVim) for a better VSCode+vim experience.
